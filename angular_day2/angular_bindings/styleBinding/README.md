What is the difference between style binding and class binding?
==============================================================
 
Style binding is used to set a style of a View element. 
We can set inline styles with style binding.

<h1 [style.font-size.px]="fontSize">Welcome to Angular</h1>


Class binding is used to set a class property of a View element. 
We can add and remove the CSS class names from an element's class attribute with class binding.

<h1 [class]="myClass">Welcome to Angular</h1>
